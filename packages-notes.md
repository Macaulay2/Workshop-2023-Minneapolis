"Nudge theory"

A file or collection of files can be installed

- instaall creates local copy and documenttaion

- ``needsPackagae`` other ways don't learn them

NEEDS:
- .m2 file wih 5 parts 

- preamble (Name in quotes == name of m2 file)
- exports things folks get to use when they import package
- code
- documentation
- tests (easier to maintain) V important

Who should write a package? Everyone

To find them, need to set path:
   - automatic if f12 from packageFile.m2
   - also can pass to installPackage

Keywords tells us where it shows up on the webpage

Where do we browse code?
      - On website
      - Can use "methods"

Package as soon as possible
	- improved debugging
	- having tests run "automatically"
	- send package to collaborators

Benefits to sharing code

Journal of Software for A/G
- usually for new functionality not increased performance
- teaser for package
- new algorithms will result in two papers (one proving alg/complexity, one in this journal)
- difficult to get fair comparisons

- magic number "N" - no one knows what this means (better to make a parameter)

Can have examples after "end--" of package

Use it to make wild guesses

tests should be smallish
advice on "future proofing" examples?
create method to do all benchmarks you want so user can do it manually.

QUESTIIONS:
 - when should we make it public share a package/publish it? A: pretty much always
