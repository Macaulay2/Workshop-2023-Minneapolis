# Category of Matrix Factorizations and Dold-Puppe extensions.
This project will be led by Keller VandeBogert (Notre Dame). The goal of this project is to implement several categorical tools that are of use and interest to commutative algebraists and algebraic geometers. This includes:
- implementing a new type MatrixFactorization and operations on them including shifts, cones, Homs, tensor products, and direct sums; 
- implementing certain K-theoretic operations on $\mathbb{Z}$/2-graded complexes, such as Euler characteristics and Adams operations;
- and implementing Dold-Puppe extensions of functors to complexes.
