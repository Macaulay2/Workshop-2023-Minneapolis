The goal of this project will be to develop the package-stub \texttt{Brackets} for Macaulay2.
The source code for this package may be found at the following url (parallel to this document): \url{https://github.com/Macaulay2/M2/Brackets/Brackets.m2}.
Here I will provide a quick introduction to the mathematics involved, the current functionality of the package, and some tasks/extensions we can pursue duing the course of the workshop.
