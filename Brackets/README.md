# Brackets and projective geometry

The goal of this project is to develop code that can be used for computing with classical invariants of the special linear group. The main functionality will be implementations of the classical straightening algorithm and shuffle product in the Grassmann Cayley algebra, which can be applied to automatic proving of theorems in projective geometry. Extensions of the current code may implement efficient strategies for working with larger examples, or build on existing functionality in the SubalgebraBases and InvariantRing packages.
