# Project Description

Given a function $\mathbb C^n \to \mathbb C^n$ with an isolated root at the origin, a basic question to ask is how it transforms space around the origin. Classically, this is detected by a topological invariant called the Brouwer degree, which is valued in the integers. Given an endomorphism of affine space over an arbitrary field k, we can similarly study how the endomorphism “transforms space” around a closed point. We may do this, for instance, by producing a symmetric bilinear form on the local k-algebra of germs of functions around the point. This type of construction has appeared in many forms in the literature: Eisenbud-Levine and Khimshiashvili developed such a bilinear form to compute local degrees of maps of real oriented manifolds in the case where the Jacobian vanishes in local coordinates, Scheja and Storch produced a bilinear form in order to study trace forms on local complete intersections, and recently Kass and Wickelgren showed that these bilinear forms agree with the A1-Brouwer degree at rational points. The A1-Brouwer degree, first defined by Morel, is the algebrao-geometric incarnation of the classical Brouwer degree from topology, and is one of the first tools used in studying motivic homotopy theory.

A recent collaboration between the project leader, McKean, and Pauli demonstrates that all of these forms agree at an arbitrary closed point, and develops a straightforward commutative algebraic approach to computing these A1-Brouwer degrees, together with some rough preliminary code implementing it (see https://github.com/shmckean/A1-degree/). The goal for this project is to refine this code into a Macaulay2 package, together with the following features:
- Implement the Grothendieck-Witt ring of symmetric bilinear forms (quadratic forms) into Macaulay2, in terms of generators and relations.
- Implement algorithms that diagonalize forms, and check when forms are isomorphic.
- Write a suite of algorithms to compute A1-Brouwer degrees, given the input of a collection of polynomials and an isolated closed point in their zero locus.
- Time pending, implement algorithms to encode how symmetric bilinear forms are traced down along finite separable field extensions.
 # A1-Brouwer Degrees.
This project will be led by Thomas Brazelton (U. Penn). Given a function $\mathbb C^n \to \mathbb C^n$ with an isolated root at the origin, a basic question to ask is how it transforms space around the origin.
