   a package to deal with subrings
  Description
   Text
     {\em Subrings} is a package to give basic subroutines for subrings.
    Caveat
     There are other subring flavor things out there.

   presentationRing
  Headline
   a polynomial ring with a variable for each subring generator
  Description
   Text
    The {\tt presentationRing} of a subring {\tt S} is a polynomial ring
    with a variable for each generator of {\tt S}.
   Example
    R = QQ[x,y];
    g = {x^2, x*y, y^2};
    S = subring g
    presentationRing S
///

   presentationMap
  Headline
   the map from the {\tt presentationRing} to a subring {\tt S}
  Description
   Text
    There is a map sending each generator of the presentation ring to
    the corresponding element of the ambient ring. This is that map.
   Example
    R = QQ[x,y];
    g = {x^2, x*y, y^2};
    S = subring g;
    f = presentationMap S
    P = presentationRing S
    p = P_0 * P_1 - P_2
    f(p)

You can write anything you want down here.  I like to keep examples
as Iâ€™m developing here.  Clean it up before submitting for
publication.  If you don't want to do that, you can omit the "end"
above.
