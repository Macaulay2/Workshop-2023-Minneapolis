# Structure of infinite resolutions
This project will be led by David Eisenbud (UC Berkeley), whose recent work with Hailong Dao studies interesting new phenomena related to the structure of the matrices in infinite free resolutions. The goal of this project is to improve the tools needed to study these phenomena and investigate some of them more systematically.
