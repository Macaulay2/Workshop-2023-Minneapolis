# InvariantRing 2+.
This project will be led by Francesca Gandini (University of Primorska and St. Olaf College). The package InvariantRing facilitates computations of invariants of linearly reductive groups in Macaulay2. The goal of this project is to continue to build on the functionality of this package by reviewing the package for possible performance improvements and implementing new functionality such as group actions for skew polynomial rings, Reynolds operators (via Lie algebras or Cayley's $\Omega $-process), and additional methods and strategies that work in positive characteristic (since many of the current methods require characteristic zero).
