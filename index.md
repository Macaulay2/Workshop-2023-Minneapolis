### Graduate Mini-school: June 3--4, 2023
The two-day mini-school consists of two lectures each day by leaders of a subset of the projects the following week in order to introduce the mathematics behind the upcoming Macaulay2 projects. Each lecture is followed by a guided problem session to solidify understanding of the topics, while also training students in the skill set necessary to use computational tools for attacking their own research questions.

<br/>

**Invited Speakers**
- Michael Brown (Auburn University): Differential modules and toric BGG
- David Eisenbud (UC Berkeley): Structure of infinite resolutions *[To be confirmed]*
- Francesca Gandini (University of Primorska and St. Olaf College): Invariant Rings
- Patricia Klein (Texas A&M University): Alternating Sign Matrix Varieties

### Macaulay2 Workshop: June 5--9, 2023
This will be a traditional Macaulay2 workshop, including morning tutorials for beginners and a professional development panel for junior participants. All participants will work to develop packages related to current areas of research and extend the core functionality of Macaulay2. New participants will join groups led by experienced members of the Macaulay2 community, and they will be trained in aspects of open-source software development.

<br/>

**Proposed Projects**
- A1-Brouwer Degrees (Thomas Brazelton)
- Alternating Sign Matrix Varieties (Ayah Almousa, Patricia Klein)
- Brackets and projective geometry (Tim Duff)
- Calculations in prime characteristic (Mordechai Katzman)
- Category of Matrix Factorizations and Dold-Puppe extensions (Keller VandeBogert)
- Differential modules and toric BGG (Michael Brown)
- InvariantRing 2+ (Francesca Gandini, Federico Galetto)
- Structure of infinite resolutions (David Eisenbud)
- Valuations (Michael Burr)
