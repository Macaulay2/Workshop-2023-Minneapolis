* F-Modules

FModule Type stores a generating morphism. Cache stores a root.

** FF (Frobenius Functor)

*** TODO Check that ring is regular. Cache result in ring.

** localCohomology

*** DONE localCohomology should cache result in ideal.

*** PROJECT Improve filter sequence version

** root

*** TODO Should also cache a root morphism

** cohomDim

*** DONE cohomDim should cache result in ideal

** associatedPrimes

*** DONE Broken! Fix it!

** randomFilterRegSeq

Given ideal I and module M, attempts to find an I-filter regular sequence on M.

User should have control over number of attempts, whether to preserve homogeneity, and over various strategies used.

*** TODO Replace generators of I with a minimal system, sorted by complexity (number of terms, degree)

*** DONE Try first to use the generators as terms of the sequence
CLOSED: [2023-06-10 Sat 12:23]

*** DONE Try linear combinations. User could control the "sparseness" of these LCs

** lyubeznikNumber and lyubeznikTable

*** DONE lyubeznikNumber should cache results
